  //The work of a program (on a given input) is

  //1.Packing and Encoding
  //2.Augmentation add information to interface
  //3.precomputation e.g. map record to object, just compute the location once
  //4.caching
  //5.sparsity e.g.Compressed Sparse Row
  //6.lazy evaluation(Stream Programming) [decouple thr order of events in our program and how we run them on machine]
